RV32I Subset Implementation

Description:
This repository hosts a Python project implementing a subset of the RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit integer) instruction set. RISC-V, an open-source ISA, is increasingly used for open-source hardware development. The project comprises an assembler and a simulator.

Assembler:
The assembler translates assembly language code into machine code. It reads assembly instructions from a text file (stdin) and generates binary output (stdout). If errors occur, it notifies the user and the line number where the error was encountered. The assembler supports two types of lines: instructions and labels.

Simulator:
The simulator executes binary files generated by the assembler. After executing each instruction, it prints the register values to a chosen file. Memory statistics are printed after completing the Virtual Halt instruction. The memory size is 32x32-bit. Memory content is printed starting from address 0x0000 0000.

Bonus (Question 3):
As a bonus, the project supports four new instructions: mul, rst, halt, and rvrs. These instructions have custom-defined encodings.

Input/Output:
- Assembler: Reads assembly program from an input text file using sys.stdin. Outputs binary format of instructions if the program is error-free.
- Simulator: Reads a binary file from an input text file using sys.stdin. Prints program counter and register values after each instruction execution. It also prints the entire memory dump at the end.

Error Handling & Flag Register:
Errors in assembly code are printed along with the line number where they occur. Error handling is implemented using IF-ELSE statements and exit() functions. Overflows and comparison instructions set the flag register.
